Purpose: App runs at 600-800 Mb (why the range) but the maximum allowable is 500 Mb.  Purpose is to reduce the memory required.

Approach: turn the app into a package with a the online and offline components separate.  The expected memory savings will come from not needing a lot of the big packages.

Old packages needed:

numpy = "*"
scipy = "*"
sklearn = "*"
pandas = "*"
nltk = "*"
bokeh = "*"
summa = {git = "https://github.com/summanlp/textrank"}
Flask = "*"
gunicorn = "*"
Django = "*"

New packages:
pandas
gunicorn
bokeh
Flask
numpy


Ommited packages
