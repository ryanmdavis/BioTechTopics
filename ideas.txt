what is an easy way to integrate NLP training algorithms into web browsing.

e.g.:
PRoduct/user workflow:
1) You install the "app" into chrome
2) The app highlights a sentence that it needs manual input for learning algorithm.

For example in the sentence "Basilea drops inhaled antibiotic, expands cancer 
program in early-stage rejig".  Is this positive about antibiotics, how about
cancer program?

3) The user answers the question in a way that can be easily used for training algorithm.  For example, for sentiment analysis the user just clicks plus or minus.

4) User gets a point. This points are financed by clients who pay for the training data results.

Key value prop: Eventually people don't change their normal browsing habbits --> reach many more people, many more people will sign up/use.

Another way to do it when there are fewer trainers is taht they click a button (think stumbleupon) and this takes them to a webpage that they then score.

Crowdflower provides crowd-sourced training data

Another idea:
Use crowdflower to quantify (how much would you pay for 1 lb of this steak?) Use this to train an image processing algorithm that prices a steak (higher for better quailtiy, lower if it is likely to be thZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzz@@SSSSSS HHHHHHHHHJJJJJ V
